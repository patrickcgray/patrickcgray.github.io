**Some favorite photos from the field:**

![secchi disk](http://patrickcgray.github.io/images/secchi_disk_pgray.jpg) 
(July 2024) S/V Tara: Lowering the secchi disk as a part of the Tara Europa sampling protocols and responsibilities of the onboard oceanographic engineer. Sampling location was just north east of Cape Sounion off the coast of Greece.

![drone flight ebee](http://patrickcgray.github.io/images/ebee_plus_nags_head.jpg) 
(August 2019) Waiting for the eBee+ fixed wing to return home during a project using drones to map the wetlands, ghost forest, and maritime forest at the Nags Head Nature Preserve on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. 

![drone flight alta](http://patrickcgray.github.io/images/alta_airborne_antarctica.jpg) 
(February 2019) R/V Laurence M. Gould:  The Freefly Alta coming back home after a mission of humpback and minke whale photogrammetry along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Julian Dale is flying the Alta and photo taken from the Gould's zodiac with Dave Johnston and others onboard.

(July 2024) S/V Tara: In the Gulf of Corinth as we move from the Ionian Sea to the Adriatic. Cleaning off the zooplankton nets after a surprise bloom of salps clogged them (and the ship's plumbing). Secchi depths are >30m yet salps and dolphins everywhere.

(August 2021) R/V Shearwater: Grabbing the DJI Phantom 4 after finishing a flight mapping the differential turbulent mixing and path of the uranine dye plume seen in the background as it crossed the Gulf Stream front. Onboard with Ivan Saveleyev, Anna Windle, Amanda Lohmann, and Julian Dale


![minke whale tagging](http://patrickcgray.github.io/images/minke_wap_af.jpg) 
(February 2019) R/V Laurence M. Gould: Slowly following a minke whale in Andvord Bay, on the right Ari Friedlaender prepares to attach a video tag. Preparing to launch the drone to capture the tagging process and measure the group of minkes from our zodiac.

(February 2019) R/V Laurence M. Gould: Photo looking straight down onto a small peninsula and shallow water from the DJI Phantom 4 just as it leaves our temporary camp on a bit of exposed rock and heads off to map sea ice in Neko Harbor.
