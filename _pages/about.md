Background 
======
I'm currently an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maine in the School of Marine Science.

I've just (Dec. 2024) finished as a Zuckerman Postdoctoral Fellow working with Emmanuel Boss and Yoav Lehahn on questions of marine patchiness, connecting polarized scattering to particle properties in the ocean, and re-assessing the pros and cons of machine learning on ocean remote sensing. In Dec. 2022 I finished my PhD with Dave Johnston in the Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Lab at the Duke University Marine Laboratory where I was a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST).

My doctoral research used satellite and drone based remote sensing to map coastal change, monitor megafauna populations, and finally to investigate submesoscale biophysical questions at the front of the Gulf Stream. Working at the confluence of remote sensing, data science, and biological oceanography I lean heavily on machine learning and scientific computing tools for parsing large amounts of remotely sensed data and connecting satellite, drone, and in-situ oceanographic monitoring. I'm particularly interested in tools and research that will be relevant for Earth science and for exploring other bodies within our solar system.

Before joining the Duke Marine Lab, I worked at Harvard University as a research technician in the deep-sea focused Girguis Lab, served a year and a half as Chief Technology Officer at WayPaver Foundation, and spent time at Moon Express as a Software Engineer developing their ground data systems and engineering team tools. I graduated from the University of North Carolina as a Morehead-Cain Scholar with a degree in Computer Science where I started UNC Students for the Exploration and Development of Space and researched computer vision.
